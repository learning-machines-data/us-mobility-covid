## **Background**
Covid-19 outbreak continues to spread rapidly and influence our daily work life. 
Due to multiple goverment laws and many other factors intended to slow spread of virus causing chnages in consumer foot traffic and its spend behavior.
This is causing demand in some category product increasing unexpectedly and at the same decreasing in others. 
We can get some insights on mobility from the data that Google presents in its COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports. 
Using anonymized data provided by apps such as Google Maps, the company has produced a regularly updated dataset that shows how peoples’ movements have changed throughout the pandemic.
This new dataset from Google measures visitor numbers to specific categories of location (e.g. grocery stores; parks; train stations) every day and compares this change relative to baseline day before the pandemic outbreak. 
Baseline days represent a normal value for that day of the week, given as median value over the five‑week period from January 3rd to February 6th 2020.
Measuring it relative to a normal value for that day of the week is helpful because people obviously often have different routines on weekends versus weekdays.
The reports chart movement trends over time by geography, across different categories of places such as retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential
